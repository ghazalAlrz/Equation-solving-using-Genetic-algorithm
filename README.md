# Equation-solving-using-Genetic-algorithm
## Overview

The `GeneticEquationSolver` class provides a method for finding solutions to nonlinear equations using a genetic algorithm. This approach employs principles of natural selection to evolve candidate solutions over generations.

## Features

- **Nonlinear Equation Solver**: Capable of solving equations defined by user-provided coefficients.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Utilizes selection, crossover, and mutation to explore potential solutions.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can adjust the population size, mutation range, and accuracy threshold.

## Installation

You can integrate this class into your Python project by copying the implementation into your codebase. Ensure you have the necessary libraries for the genetic algorithm (if any are used in the implementation).

## Usage

### Initialization

To use the `GeneticEquationSolver`, initialize it with the coefficients of the nonlinear equation, along with optional parameters for accuracy, population size, and mutation range.

```python
from typing import Tuple

# Example coefficients for a nonlinear equation
coefficients = (1.0, -3.0, 2.0, 0.0)

# Create an instance of GeneticEquationSolver
solver = GeneticEquationSolver(
    coefficients=coefficients,
    accuracy=1e-6,
    population_size=1000,
    mutation_range=(0.9, 1.1)
)
